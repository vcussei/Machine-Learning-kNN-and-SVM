# knn & SVM
K-nearest neighbor (knn) + Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The machine learning code presented here was written in the MATLAB. The objective is to predict the type of soil by inputing the electrical resistivity of the soil obtained using using Wenner's four electrode technique. This code is part of a thesis that aims to develop a device that prevents corrosion by measuring the resistivity of soil (ex. clay soil) in which metal equipment is to be burried, applying machine learnig algorithm (k-nearst neighbor and SVM) to predict the type of soil, and utlilizing the extracted parameters to optimize for the material selected to withsatand corrosion in that specific enviroment.
