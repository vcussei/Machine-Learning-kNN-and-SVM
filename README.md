# knn & SVM
K-nearest neighbor (knn) + Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The machine learning codes presented here were written in the MATLAB. The objective is to predict the type of soil by inputing the electrical resistivity of the soil obtained using using Wenner's four electrode technique. This code is part of a thesis that aims to develop a device that prevents corrosion by measuring the resistivity of soil (ex. clay soil) in which metal equipment is to be burried, applying machine learnig algorithm (k-nearst neighbor and SVM) to predict the type of soil, and utlilizing the extracted parameters to optimize for the material selected to withsatand corrosion in that specific enviroment. 

You can run the code by:
1-knn
-copy and paste the knn file. 
-add the loaded files to your matlab path 
-run
2-SVM
-copy and paste the svm_mlx file. 
-add the loaded files to your matlab path 
-run 
3-confusion matrix 
-copy and paste the confusion matrix file. 
-add the loaded files to your matlab path 
-run
